Description of the files:
==========================

This folder contains the predictions computed with
the machine learning method BLM [1] for several datasets.
[1] K. Bleakley and Y. Yamanishi.
*Supervised prediction of drug-target interactions
using bipartite local models*.
Bioinformatics, 25(18):2397-2403, 2009.


For all the files is given the probability that the prediction is real interaction.
The predictions are ranked for probability. The most probable prediction to be a real
interaction is ranked first with a higher probability.
